            <h1>What to Expect</h1>
            <h2>It can be tough to think of project ideas</h2>
            <p>In fact, this is one of the most common frustrations I hear when I talk to people who are learning to code.

            </p>
            <p>To help everyone out, I decided to ask the experts what sorts of projects they would recommend.</p>
            <p>Here's who I asked</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Chris Coyier (CSS-Tricks and CodePen)</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Jim Hibbard (JavaScript Editor at Sitepoint)</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Sara Soueidan (Dev of the Year and writer at Codrops)</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Ben Moss (Editor at Webdesigner Depot)</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Laurence Bradford (Learn to Code With Me)</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Parker Phinney (Interview Cake)/a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="">Zell Liew (ZellWK.com)</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For each person on this list, I'll quote their suggestion and then follow it up with commentary (difficulty level, reasons the suggestion is effective, etc).</p>
            <p>Huge thanks to everyone who answered!</p>

                <h1>Chris Coyier</h1>
                <p>Founder: CSS-Tricks, Co-Founder: CodePen, Co-Host: ShopTalk, Author: A clear, helpful book called Practical SVG</p>
                <h1>Project ideas from Chris</h1>
                <blockquote>I like the idea of copying a website as closely as you can. You'd only do this for practice, never for something you'd present as your own work. But a lot can be learned from emulating something you already like.</blockquote>
                <h1>Commentary</h1>
                <p>What I like about Chris's suggestion:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It can be whatever difficulty level you want.
                    </li>
                    <li>You won't run out of projects until you run out of sites on the entire internet.</li>
                    <li>It deals with the importance of giving credit where credit is due.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Jim Hibbard</h1>
                <p>JavaScript Editor at Sitepoint</p>
                <h1>Project ideas from Chris</h1>
                <blockquote>One of the things I'd recommend is taking a component built with one technology and trying to reimplement it yourself in another.

                    For example, there are a ton of lightbox widgets out there and for a beginner, this can seem like magic — you include the lib, add a couple of data attributes to some elements and voilà, you have lightbox functionality.</blockquote>
                <h1>Commentary</h1>
                <p>Here's what I like about Jim's approach:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Deeper understanding</strong>
Implementing things in different ways helps give you a deeper understanding of the tools you use.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Self-reliance</strong>
                        It's important to get comfortable enough that you don't need to rely on a plugin for everything.</li>
                    <li><strong>Better code performance</strong>
With practice, you'll be able to write the functionality you need without the extra baggage from a full plugin. To be clear, there are times when it will make sense to use a tool or plugin, but it's important to understand when it makes sense.</li>
                </ul>
